The executable software system for the algorithm ATCLM proposed in the paper "An active three-way clustering method via low-rank matrices for multi-view data". 
This repository contains:
1.	User guide for the ATCLM System.pdf  This file is the user guider for the ATCLM algorithm proposed in the paper: Hong Yu, Xincheng Wang, Guoyin Wang, Xianhua Zeng,An active three-way clustering method via low-rank matrices for multi-view data, Information Sciences 507 (2020) 823–839. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2018.03.009. You can find the environment configuration and the instructions.
2.	The first case in Environmental Configuration, namely, files in the atclm_win_10_64.zip, are had expanded in the current repository. 
3.	The second case, atclm_win_10_64_matlab.zip, the system with MATALB is uploaded to cloud drive. You can get it by the link："https://pan.baidu.com/s/1IgLWgX4Adg_HY8EJCqaRRw", and the password is <b>ys14</b>.
