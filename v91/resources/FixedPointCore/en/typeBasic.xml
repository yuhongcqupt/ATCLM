    <entry key="DifferentBestPrecisionScalingToAvoidOverflow">The value ({0}) being scaled is between RepMin-LSB ({1}) and RepMin ({2}), where RepMin is the representable minimum of the proposed data type. In order to avoid possible overflow, for the given WordLength ({3}) and Signedness ({4}) the best precision scaling algorithm proposes FractionLength as {5} instead of {6}.</entry>
