      Querying current time via a sample-time ''{0}'' which does not belong to the
      currently executing task. This can lead to non-deterministic 
      behavior or data corruption in actual implementation. When dealing with
      multi-rate blocks, please make sure that you query the current task's time 
      via a sample-time which has a hit.
