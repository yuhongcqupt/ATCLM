    <entry key="generateSFuncModelRefParamMismatch">Generation of an S-function
    for a subsystem that contains one or more Model blocks has detected a
    configuration parameters mismatch.
 
    \n\nThe mismatch is due to one of these causes:

    \nA) Before S-function generation, there was a configuration parameter
    mismatch in the model reference hierarchy of model ''{0}''.
    
    \nB) S-function generation setup changed configuration parameter settings.
 
    \n\nTo determine which is the cause in this case, try building the model
    ''{1}''.
    
    \n- If the build fails because of a configuration parameter mismatch, then
    cause "A" applies.

    \n- If the build succeeds, cause "B" applies.
 
    \n\nTo address cause "A", make the configuration parameters listed below match
    throughout the model hierarchy and try rebuilding model ''{2}'' until it
    builds successfully.  Once the model builds successfully, try generating the
    S-Function again. If the S-Function generation fails, then you will need to
    address cause "B".
 
    \n\nTo address cause "B", adjust the parameters of your model hierarchy based on
    the mismatches described below, so that your hierarchy matches the settings
    of ''{3}''.</entry>
