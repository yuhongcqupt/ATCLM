    <entry key="Error">
      Solver encountered an error while simulating model ''{0}'' at time {1} and cannot
      continue. Please check the model for errors.
    </entry>

    <entry key="Warning">
      Solver is encountering difficulty in simulating model ''{0}'' at time {1}. Simulink will
      continue to simulate with warnings. Please check the model for errors.

    <entry key="StateNotFinite">  
      Continuous state ''{0}'' of ''{1}'' at time {2} is not finite.
      Simulink will terminate the simulation.  There may be a singularity in the
      solution. Check the model ''{3}'' for errors. Try reducing the fixed step size
      or tighten the error tolerances for variable-step solvers.

    <entry key="InvSrcBlkOutBeingMergedAndUsedToComputeDeriv">
      It is invalid to merge the non-continuous signal from block ''{0}'' output
      port {1,number,integer} with other continuous signals because the merged
      signal is driving an input port used to compute the derivative of a
      continuous state.
