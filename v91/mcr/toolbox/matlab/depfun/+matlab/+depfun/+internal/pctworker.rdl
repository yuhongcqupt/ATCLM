% REQUIREMENTS expects these files to exist in the target environment, and

Expect PCTWorker [

% Even if these files would be optimized out of the parts list, allow them if
% they were explicitly specified as inputs to REQUIREMENTS. 

Allow PCTWorker ROOTSET [

% These files should never be included in any parts list.

Exclude PCTWorker [

% These rules help REQUIREMENTS include files that it has difficulty discovering
% through analysis. For example, a GUIDE GUI depends on both a MATLAB function
% and a FIG file, but the FIG file is never explicitly referenced in the 
% MATLAB function (MATLAB magically detects and loads the FIG file). Since
% REQUIREMENTS can't discover the FIG file through analysis of the MATLAB
% function, give it a hint: if there's a FIG file with the same name as a
% MATLAB file in the ROOTSET, include the FIG file in the ROOTSET too.

Remove PCTWorker ROOTSET [
isbuiltin(#ROOTSET) ? msg2why(message('MATLAB:depfun:req:BuiltinEntryPoint', #FILE), #RULE)
]

% Non-executable files in the ROOTSET need to move into the COMPLETION.
Move PCTWorker ROOTSET COMPLETION [

% Insert FIG files with the same base name as M files. Make sure to only
% insert files that don't already exist. (Call setdiff to filter out existing
% files.)
%
% Order matters. Insert these files after removing non-function files, or the
% FIG files (which are not function files) will get removed.

Insert PCTWorker COMPLETION [
